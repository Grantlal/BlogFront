                Hi there! Welcome to where I'm going to keep a bunch of knowledge on my cooking habits. For the first entry I don't think I will go over any particular
                recipe, and instead I will give you an idea what kinds of recipes to expect from me. Throughout this first post I will go through some of my favorite 
                cuisine types, tools I use, and techniques I frequent. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To start I wanted to go over what kinds of dishes you might expect out of me. I'm no Bobby Flay, and that means I don't have "specialty" cuisine type I 
                gravitate towards. I'm very much like my peers and I like being able to go get chimichangas, fried chicken, italian, and basically everything else anytime
                I want.

        );
