                Hi there! Welcome to where I'm going to keep a bunch of knowledge on my cooking habits. For the first entry I don't think I will go over any particular
                recipe, and instead I will give you an idea what kinds of recipes to expect from me. Throughout this first post I will go through some of my favorite 
                tools I use in the kitchen, and whatever miscellaneous extras I feel we need to cover. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To start I think that the tools you use in the kitchen are highly important. It's similar to the idea that how can build something of quality from something
                that is not of quality. Anyways I think the most important tools I use most frequently are some sort of nice pan (We can go so into depth on this is absurd), 
                a half decent knife set, quite a large stockpot, and some random other objects maybe. Anyways the normally the big debate I see on cooking discussion is about
                the knife. By all means if you are passionate for knives and their construction I totally understand. A high grade cutlery set is something I really wish I 
                had. Instead I think the method of cooking is what will really help. For this you need good pans and to take of them. I currently am on a big cast iron binge
                of cooking as that thing is magical. Like the crust you can develop with a cast iron is just wonderful. I definitely recommend getting one if you don't have one, 
                but unfortunately it's not as totally versatile as a stainless steel or non-stick for that matter. I also frequent the non-stick, I know I shouldn't, but I'm poor. 
                Someone send me an all clad. Anyways moving on the knife discussion again I've used a cheap set of knives that were really sharp and that worked fantastic. My one
                Chef's knife from a inexpesive set (Like $40?) lasted me nearly a year with absolutely no problems. I occassionally tried to keep it sharp and it was perfect. I
                only had a few small oopsies through the year too using it. This leads up to the stockpot. Another tool that I think is such an underrated piece of kitchen equipment. 
                With a single large stockpot you can make any amount of pasta, soups, broths, CHILI, seriously you name it. The stainless steel stockpot I had was perfect to maybe
                brown some meat and vegetables, then use the fond it made to make deliciuous soups and chili. Is chili a soup? Let me know how you feel. I think it's a grey area and 
                I probably lean more towards it not being a soup. Distractions aside the large stainless stockpot is amazing and you should invest the money into one. Now this list
                isn't everything I use, but it's what I use most frequently. So I think if you get a quality pan you love, have a semi decent knife set, and that stockpot you can make
                basically whatever you want.

                There really isn't much else I actually wanted to talk about here actually. So thank you for reading and I look forward to being able to continue down this path of culinary
                adventure with everyone reading.
