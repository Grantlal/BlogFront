                    <pre class="startTab" /> I think this is the part where I decide how to explain what I'm doing here, but the problem I keep running into is that I'm 
                    not exactly sure what I'm doing here. Ultimately I believe this will be a playground for myself to play with a bunch of new technologies, design patterns,
                    ways to approach problems, etc. Then I get to talk about how I felt about using them, and if you know me, you know I like talking about my opinions.

                    On top of just technology I also want to talk about the other passions I have. For now this will include any recipes I have been working on. So I hope you're
                    looking forward to great new meal ideas. Besides just cooking I'm also going to discuss various different sports topics. For now those have been classified 
                    under boarding, hockey, and miscellaneous. Boarding will contain posts about skateboarding, longboard, and snowboarding typically. Mostly that content will
                    depending on seasons, and lately I have reignited my fire for skateboarding. Hockey is self explanatory. Lastly I also have a lot of minor interests, or 
                     more so less interesting topics, that I might have some extra content for like running or basketball. These will go under miscellaneous for now.
