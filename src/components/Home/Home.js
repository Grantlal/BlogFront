                    <pre class="startTab" /> So I think this is the part where I decide how to explain what I'm doing here, but the problem I keep running into is that I'm 
                    not exactly sure what I'm doing here. Ultimately I believe this will be a playground for myself to play with a bunch of new technologies, design patterns,
                    ways to approach problems, etc. Then I get to talk about how I felt about using them, and if you know me, you know I like talking about my opinions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of just technology I also want to talk about the other passions I have. For now this will include any recipes I have been working on. So I hope you're
                    looking forward to great new meal ideas. Originally I was going to also include a bunch of my personal hobbies to write about. I shortened the original list to
                    only include boarding now. When I started building this site I was originally including a bunch more, but decided against it. Later if I wish to go down that rabbit 
                    hole I think I will make a sister blog. Then I can talk about the technology on this blog about building the other blog. It'll be neat. Anyways once I began development
                    including all that extra work it proved to be a lot to initally maintain, and honestly that not what I'm here for. Ultimately I would like to stay agile and make 
                    the small functional changes whenever I can as I can. So hopefully I can get this out there pretty soon so anyone interested can take a read!
