              Yo welcome to the what could be the best section here! The first thing I wanted to talk about here is a brief overview of my skateboarding story. 
              If we start out that way once I start going into more specific content hopefully you the reader can better understand where I'm coming from. 
              Without any more fluff let's move onto to the good stuff.

              So I started getting into skateboarding when I was in my early pre-teen years. I'm imagining around 6-7th grade is when the group really started.
