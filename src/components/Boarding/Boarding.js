              Yo welcome to the what could be the best section here! The first thing I wanted to talk about here is a brief overview of my skateboarding story. 
              If we start out that way once I start going into more specific content hopefully you the reader can better understand where I'm coming from. 
              Without any more fluff let's move onto to the good stuff.

              So I started getting into skateboarding when I was in my early pre-teen years. I'm imagining around 6-7th grade is when the group really started. 
              We obviously had all played Tony Hawk games and what not, but now we wanted to get into skateboarding for real. So I remember I was using my
              brother's old board, and he didn't want me to really play with it at all. So my friend and I started searching for boards on craigslist. We found
              an old zero board and went for it. Then I got an old pair of the venture salt and peppers from another buddy. I don't recall the wheels or bearings
              at all though so anyone from that time feel free to chime in... 
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyways the gang started to skateboard a lot more. This started with our driveways and the streets where we learned some basic tricks like ollies and
              shuv-ies. We actually also bought a small round-flat rail and absolutely horrendous kicker. When we found out none of us could hit those things we ended
              up building planky. Planky was made from some old two by fours and the metal end of a bed frame. This legend sits a solid like 10 inches maybe from the
              ground, and has a few screws that stick out. The beauty of this obstacle was though, that we could hit it. So I remember having the guys over and 
              we would have a little driveway session with planky and the other obstacles. After we were tuckered out we'd go back inside and pound some Dr Pepper 
              probably and paly videogames until three in the morning. We didn't go to the skatepark really much at all yet, but that's coming. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I now had become a freshman in high school and that's when I started going to the skatepark a lot more. Meeting some friends in school who also were 
              interested in skateboarding we needed a place to meet and that was the skatepark. During this time I skated the most I ever have in my life. Basically 
              everyday after school I would go right to the skatepark and "shred" for hours. I was starting to get some box tricks, I could hit rails occassionally, 
              and I loved playing S.K.A.T.E. For those of you that don't know what S.K.A.T.E. is, imagine a game of horse for basketball. Instead of trick shots, 
              you try to match tricks. I like to think I was alright at the game, but since I still can't flip a kickflip well I really wasn't. Anyways most of my 
              skating ended there pretty quickly as I ended up breaking my wrist fairly badly in 2012 which lead to me having a plate and a few screws put in. This 
              made ended up making me try something new and I had always wanted to play hockey so I shot for stars and did that.

              Anyways queue up college and how one of my old skate buddies became my roommate, and two other buddies lived in the same building on the same floor as us
              it was only a matter of time until we ended up skating again. Which we did quite a few times at the Plaza. The obstacles here were all much bigger and 
              honestly didn't allow me to grow much as a skater. There were some fun things to hit like a little three stair, and a manny pad. After another year or two 
              skating here infrequently I basically stopped again once I found snowboarding. I think that story is for another time, but ultimately I stopped skating 
              altogether for the next few years until recently. 
            </p>

              Fast forward to me about to move across the country and I started to get interested in skating again. I blame "The Nine Club" as they run quite the
              entertaining podcast. I start skating a bit more for fun here and there, but there's a global pandemic going on right now that frowns upon me going to 
              the skateparks. My last board was probably about 5 years old and just got a massive pressure crack so I bought a new deck and shoes. I'm really excited to
              continue learning and becoming a better skateboarder as time goes on. I think for the next entry in the skateboarding side I'm going to talk about the new deck
              and how it's fairly different from what I'm used to. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this as I know it couldn't have been that enticing. We'll 
              start gettin to the juicy opinions soon, I promise!
