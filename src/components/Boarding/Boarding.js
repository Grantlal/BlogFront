              Yo welcome to the what could be the best section here! The first thing I wanted to talk about here is a brief overview of my skateboarding story. 
              If we start out that way once I start going into more specific content hopefully you the reader can better understand where I'm coming from. 
              Without any more fluff let's move onto to the good stuff.

              So I started getting into skateboarding when I was in my early pre-teen years. I'm imagining around 6-7th grade is when the group really started. 
              We obviously had all played Tony Hawk games and what not, but now we wanted to get into skateboarding for real. So I remember I was using my
              brother's old board, and he didn't want me to really play with it at all. So my friend and I started searching for boards on craigslist. We found
              an old zero board and went for it. Then I got an old pair of the venture salt and peppers from another buddy. I don't recall the wheels or bearings
              at all though so anyone from that time feel free to chime in...

              Anyways the gang started to skateboard a lot more. This started with our driveways and the streets where we learned some basic tricks like ollies and
              shuv-ies. We actually also bought a small round-flat rail and absolutely horrendous kicker. When we found out none of us could hit those things we ended
              up building planky. Planky was made from some old two by fours and the metal end of a bed frame. This legend sits a solid like 10 inches maybe from the
              ground, and has a few screws that stick out. The beauty of this obstacle was though, that we could hit it. So I remember having the guys over and 
              we would have a little driveway session with planky and the other obstacles. After we were tuckered out we'd go back inside and pound some Dr Pepper 
              probably and paly videogames until three in the morning. We didn't go to the skatepark really much at all yet, but that's coming.
