# Grant's Blog
Well hello there. This repository is a personal project of mine so that I have a place where I can eventually upload blog posts and discuss fun things like technology and 
snowboarding. For now this is a basic web application built using react that has some blog entries in it. Honestly anyone feel free to open any fun discussions or feature requests so that I have work and somebody I can try to impress. Below are the more important node commands I might need for reference later. Have fun dissecting code!
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
